Hi! I am Johannes - a software engineer.

## Background in computers and programming

Ever since I can think I was interested in computers. When I was nine years old I got an electronic building kit to experiment with building small circuits and creating various devices, such as Radios. 
Right around when I entered "Gymnasium" - the German high school - I started learning Python. I did not build anything fancy, I was just trying to get a general concept of what it means to code by building small terminal games like "guess the number".

A little bit later, around the age of 13, I could finally choose "computer science" as a subject in school. We learned about if-statements, loops or Object Oriented Programming, and later studied more complex things like sorting algorithms, different data structures, SQL and programming in Java.

After finishing my "A-levels" - the German "Abitur" - I moved to Berlin to start my software engineering studies at __CODE UNIVERSITY__. CODE focuses on providing real world skills, by having a project oriented learning approach. Every Semester I can choose to start a new project, continue an old or join an already existing one, to learn about various topics, like web development, artificial Intelligence, low level programming and much more.

## Work experience

After my second semester at CODE I joined __Automagically__, as a working student. I learned the basics of building a web application with Python and Django and how to deploy it on __Heroku__. Additionally I got some experience on best practices in test driven development with Python.

In February 2022 I joined __Sameday Health__ as a __NodeJS__, __Typescript__ backend engineer. I was responsible for designing and creating a notification service, which sent out thousands of end-customer messages daily.

At the beginning of 2023 I joined Sonic, a software studio, as a backend engineer, contributing to projects with different companies, like Junto and Milano Vice.

## Skills

As a software engineer, I have developed broad skill set, that helps me design, build and deploy scalable, high quality software projects.

### Technical skills

Although I've mainly worked as a backend developer, I have some basic skills in React and NextJS. But my main area of expertise lies in building applications with NodeJS, Typescript, SQLite and PostgreSQL, using libraries like Express, TRPC, TypeORM and Prisma. For a university project I have also set up a Go backend with gin-gonic and gorm.

Python is the first programming language I've ever learned and I still have a good understanding of it's syntax. I like to use it in smaller scripts, or for example when I learned the basics of artificial intelligence at CODE.

I have also used other programming languages like C, C++ and Java for example in smaller side projects.

### Soft skills

I like to work in teams, where I can help with my strong problem solving skills and a keen attention to detail, without loosing the view for the big picture and proactively thinking and communicating ideas to solve problems.

## Interests

I was a co-leader of the Hackers Club at CODE, where we discussed various topics regarding cyber security and attack vectors, mainly on web apps.

Back at my home town I was part of the youth fire brigade and the DLRG, where I got my Jugend-Rettungsschwimmer (youth lifeguard) batch.
