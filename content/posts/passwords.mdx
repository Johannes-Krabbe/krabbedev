# Everyone can be hacked.

There are multiple ways a hacker could gain access to your bank account, a socialmedia account, a cloud storage service you are using or really anything else. There are always new bugs and exploits found, wich then get sold for insane amounts of money in the darknet. Usually software manufactures are pretty fast with fixing known issues, but they can only help you if you keep your software up to date.
Other posabilities a hacker could gain access to your accounts is by just trying a lot of common passwords or even better, gather information about you, your family and friends and combine this information in each possible way to have a chance to figure out your password.

# Why should I be a target of a attack?

There are multiple reasons why a hacker might be interested in hacking you.

The most obvious beeing money. Everything is online and digital nowadays: your Bank, your communication with buisiness partners or friends. Imagine someone hacking your email account, imitating your "style of writing" an email and sending invoices to buisiness partners. Or a friend of yours asks you to lend them some money and send it to a new bank accont. Those are some obvious techniques, but hackers can get realy creative when they find a good target.

An other type of person could be someone from your personal live. Maybe someone who hates you and wants to harm you in any way or someone who likes you to much and is obsest with finding out every detail about your live.
They might be interested in reading your private messages on a social media platform or gaining access to your cloud storage to find private photos or important documents.

# Use good passwords

A hacker will always ask themself if the potential cost of hacking you is lower then theyre potential gain, so in order to not get hacked you either need a security system that only can get craced if a hacker uses more recouces (money) than they would get.
For example if you have 10.000 euro in your bank account but in order to hack you a hacker would need to rent out a computer for 20.000 euro they probatly wont do it. But if they could get instead of 10.000 euro, 100.000 euro, an "investment" of 20.000 euro does not seam so bad.

A very important rule when chosing a new password is **DO NOT EVER REUSE A PASSWORD**. Big companies are target of attacks all the time and its fairly easy if you have a huge list of email-password pairs, to just try them out on a lot of other different websites.
Some people also change theyre email for every new account they are creating, so if they see theyre email getting leaked somewhere they directly know which account got comprimized. This might be a little over the top for a lot people but it is always a question of how much a hacker could gain by hacking you.

The most common passwords according to [nordpass](https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/) are:

```
1)	123456
2)	123456789
3)	12345
4)	qwerty
5)	password
6)	12345678
7)	111111
8)	123123
9)	1234567890
10)	1234567
11)	qwerty123
12)	000000
13)	1q2w3e
14)	aa12345678
15)	abc123
16)	password1
17)	1234
18)	qwertyuiop
19)	123321
20)	password123
```

Its very obvious the most common passwords are bad passwords, because good passwords would never make it to the list. good passwords are unique

### "Word123.!" is not a good password

A common theme with these popular passwords is to use a word, followed by some numbers and finishing of with a satzzeichen.

how log does it take to crack a password?

# How to secure your passwords

Now that we know how to create a secure password, we have to remember it. But scince not everyone of us has an identic memory, most of us have to store them somewhere.

### Create a file on your desktop named passwords

This is not a bad joke. Someone I know actually does that.
pro

-   easy accesible (easy to use)

con

-   gaining access to files on a not encrypted hard drive is easy if you have phisical access to the pc
-   hackable

### Just write them down on paper?

Writing your passwords down on paper is theoretically a good idea but it looses points in practiability.

pro

-   cant be hacked

con

-   easy to lose
-   not convinient (copy passwords) its easy to just go back to bad passwords
-   if you are not on your pc (where you store your piece of paper) and want to log in to an account you cant do it
-   when creating new accounts while not at home its convinient to default to you easy to remember password

### What is a password manager?

#### Online password managers

#### Offline password managers

Some people might think having an Online password manager defeats the purpose of having a password manager

# Two Factor Authentication and other security messures you could take

-   2fa with sms if you can see incoming sms on your lock screen you can bypass 2fa by looking on a locked phone
-   2fa with authenticatior app (more research) if you lose your mobile or it gets stolen you lost access to your account
-   2fa with a yubi key (you need two and have to carry them if you want to log in anywhere)

if you have to share your password for some reaseon reset is as soon as possible

Mobile apps can look what you copied
